# ChurnSeg-Insight

This project utilizes free customer data from **Kaggle** to explore, predict, and visualize customer behavior. The main goal is to understand churn patterns, segment customers using behavioral metrics, and communicate insights through interactive Power BI dashboards, as well as my thought process behind every decision and models used. 

## ✅ Project Highlights

- 🔍 **Churn Prediction:**  
  Machine learning classification to predict which customers are at risk of leaving(churning). 

- 🧩 **Customer Segmentation:**  
  Applied RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with clustering to uncover distinct customer groups.

- 📊 **Power BI Dashboard:**  
  Created interactive visualizations to present key business insights and patterns effectively.

- ⚡ **Dash for Practice:**  
  Also leveraged Dash to experiment with visualizations.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data analysis and modeling  
- **Churn prediction (Random Forest Classifier, Logistic regression, SVM, KNN, Gradient Boosting Classifier)** 
- **RFM Analysis & Clustering** for customer segmentation  
- **Power BI** for interactive dashboards and executive-ready visualizations  
- **Dash** for dashboard creation and visualization. 

## 📊 Key Business Questions Answered

- Which customers are likely to churn?  
- What are the characteristics of different customer segments?  
- How does spending behavior vary by segment?  
- What should the business strategy be for each segment based on this data? 
- How can visual tools like Power BI enhance business decision-making?  

## 🚀 How to Explore the Project

1. Open **churn.ipynb** to review churn prediction modeling and EDA.  
2. Open **segmentation.ipynb** for RFM-based segmentation.  
3. Review the **Power BI Dashboard** using [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/).  
4. Explore **screenshots/** for quick dashboard previews.  
5. Check **dash.py** for visualization.

## 📂 Data Source

This project uses publicly available customer behavior data from Kaggle.

## 💡 Future Enhancements

- Add real-time churn monitoring with dashboards  
- Explore time-series analysis if historical transactions are available  
- Further automate segment-specific business recommendations
